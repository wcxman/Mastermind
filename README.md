EECE2560 Project 1: Mastermind [UNFINISHED]

Allows the user to play the "Mastermind" game, giving the computer a length of the password and the range of numbers the password can be constructed out of. The user then guesses a value and the computer says how many numbers are in the right location, and how many numbers are in the password but not at the guessed location.
